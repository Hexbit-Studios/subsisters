## ðŸš€ Overview

This is a game made during the month of October for [Hacktoberfest 2022](https://hacktoberfest.com). It is a simple survivor game where the player controls one of four sisters to fight against an increasingly difficult horde of monsters. It is inspired by games like:

- Vampire Survivors [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)
- Spirit Hunters: Infinite Horde [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1914580/Spirit_Hunters_Infinite_Horde/)
- Grimnight Heroes [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GoldHelmGames.grimnightheroes&hl=en_US&gl=US) [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grimnight-heroes-survivors/id1622309988)
- Survivor.io [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dxx.firenow&hl=en_US&gl=US) [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/survivor-io/id1528941310)


The player mostly only moves the character around the world while avoiding touching enemies, projectiles, and other hazards while any weapons or abilities they have are used automatically to defeat enemies. Defeating enemies allows the player to collect experience points which can be used to level up and acquire new abilities during the run.

This type of game is also known as a _reverse bullet hell_.
